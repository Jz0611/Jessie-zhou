<p> The frist one:The Hunger Games trilogy takes place in an unspecified future time, in the dystopian, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, located in North America.The country consists of a wealthy Capitol city, located in the Rocky Mountains,surrounded by twelve (originally thirteen) poorer districts ruled by the Capitol. The Capitol is lavishly rich and technologically advanced, but the districts are in varying states of poverty. The trilogy's narrator and protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, lives in District 12, the poorest region of Panem, located in Appalachia,where people regularly die of starvation. As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol (called the "Dark Days"), in which District 13 was destroyed, one boy and one girl from each of the twelve remaining districts, between the ages of 12 and 18, are selected by lottery to compete in an annual pageant called the Hunger Games. The Games are a televised event in which the participants, called "tributes", are forced to fight to the death in a dangerous public arena. The winning tribute and his or her home district are then rewarded with food, supplies, and riches. The purposes of the Hunger Games are to provide entertainment for the Capitol and to remind the districts of the Capitol's power and its lack of remorse or forgiveness for the failed rebellion of the current competitors' ancestors.</p>
<p>AI writer correct:The Hunger Games trilogy is set in an indeterminate future in the dystopian, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in North America, which consists of a wealthy capital city in the Rocky Mountains surrounded by twelve (originally thirteen) poorer districts ruled by the Capitol. The Capitol is prosperous and technologically advanced, while the districts live in varying degrees of poverty. The narrator and protagonist of the trilogy, Katniss Everdeen, lives in District 12, the poorest region of Panem in Appalachia, where people regularly starve. As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol (called the "Dark Days") in which District 13 was destroyed, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are drawn from each of the twelve remaining districts to participate in an annual competition called the Hunger Games. The games are a televised event in which participants, known as "tributes," are forced to fight to the death in a dangerous public arena. The victorious tribute and his or her home district are then rewarded with food, supplies and riches. The Hunger Games serve to entertain the Capitol and remind districts of the Capitol's power and its lack of remorse or forgiveness for the failed rebellion of the ancestors of today's participants.</p>

<p>The second one:<em>Stranger Things</em> is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, Indiana, during the 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department of energy but secretly does experiments into the paranormal and supernatural, including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an alternate dimension, "the Upside Down". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.The first season begins in November 1983. Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down. His mother, Joyce; the town's police chief, Jim Hopper; and a group of volunteers search for him. A young psychokinetic girl named Eleven escapes from the laboratory and is found by friends of Will. Eleven befriends and assists them in their efforts to find Will.The second season is set a year later in October 1984. Will has been rescued, but he begins having premonitions of the fall of Hawkins caused by a creature in the Upside Down. When it is discovered that Will is still being possessed by an entity from the Upside Down, his friends and family learn that there is a larger threat to their world.The third season is set several months later, in the days leading up to the Forth of July celebration in 1985. The new Starcourt Mall has become the center of attention for Hawkins residents, putting the majority of other local stores out of business due to the mall's popularity. Hopper becomes increasingly concerned about Eleven and Mike's relationship and becomes very protective of his daughter. Unbeknownst to the town, a secret Soviet laboratory underneath Starcourt seeks to open the gateway to the Upside Down. Meanwhile, the Mind Flayer uses mind control to make Billy do his bidding.The fourth season is set several months later, in March 1986. Joyce, Will, Eleven, and Jonathan have moved to Lenora, California for a fresh start. In California, Eleven struggles with the loss of her powers and being bullied in school. Meanwhile in Hawkins, a being from the Upside Down—an entity later dubbed Vecna—begins killing the residents of Hawkins, opening new gates between the two worlds in the process.
