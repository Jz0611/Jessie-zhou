<h1>My favorite hobby:Traveling</h1>
<p> As a hobby, traveling keeps us busy during the weekends. It is the best to method untiliuse time. Traveling is great, we go travling for a few days or weeks come back fresh and take challenges of life head on. Most people do not understand how moving from one place to another will be categorizedÂ with fun activities, like watching movie, swimming, drawing or dancing. When there're some tradditional days, my parents'll take me to go somewhere else traveling. We'll go traveling at least one time a year. This summer vacation, my parents'll take me tralvel to Tokyo. For the summary, traveling is really a great hobby, you can also go travel.</p>
